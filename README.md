## 🧠 About Me

I’m a data professional with experience translating complex, multi-source data into insights that executives, managers, and teams can actually use.

I enjoy solving problems and generating new ideas to address challenges where:
- Data is messy or fragmented  
- Business questions are unclear and constantly evolving  
- Structure and intent make the difference  

My long-term goal is to grow into an **Analytics Engineer role**, strengthening the bridge between raw data, analytical models, and business outcomes.
