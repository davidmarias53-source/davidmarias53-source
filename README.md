# 👋 Hi, I’m David  
**Data Analyst | Aspiring Analytics Engineer**

I design data models and analytics solutions that turn scaterred data into **clear, trusted business decisions**.  
My work is all about **business understanding, clean data modeling, and actionable insights**.

Most dashboards fail not because of visuals, but because of weak foundations.  
I focus on **model-first analytics**, building robust data structures that scale and answer real business questions before a single chart or dashboard is created.

This repository showcases projects where **data modeling, analytics, and storytelling** come together to support confident decision-making.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a data professional with experience translating complex, multi-source data into insights that executives, managers, and teams can actually use.

I enjoy solving problems and generating new ideas to address challenges where:
- Data is messy or fragmented  
- Business questions are unclear and constantly evolving  
- Structure and intent make the difference  

My long-term goal is to grow into an **Analytics Engineer role**, strengthening the bridge between raw data, analytical models, and business outcomes.
